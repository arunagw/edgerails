For those looking for a way to manipulate your Rails application before the main initializer block of your @environment.rb@ file runs, your wish has been "answered":http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/8159.

If a @config/preinitializer.rb@ file exists, Rails will load it prior to the @environment.rb@ file, letting you have at the Rails classes before plugins do and before the environment is loaded.
