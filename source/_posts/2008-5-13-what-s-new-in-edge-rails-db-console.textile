For those of you that haven't committed the database username and passwords for your many apps to memory yet, there comes some help from edge Rails - the addition of a @dbconsole@ script that will automatically drop you into a database prompt using the info in @config/database.yml@ configuration.

In an edge rails app that has a mysql db config:

_Update:_ Because of the insecure nature of passing in the password on the command line on shared hosts - you now need to use the @-p@ or @--include-password@ option to force the password to be read from your config file.

<code><pre>
script/dbconsole -p
...
mysql>
</pre></code>

And there I am, logged into the dev database in the mysql command prompt.  No scrounging around for that app-specific username or db name or @cat@ ing the @config/database.yml@ file anymore.
