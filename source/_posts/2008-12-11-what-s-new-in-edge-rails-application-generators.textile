span(version). *Rails* 2.3 or 3.0

I'm way late to the party on "this one":http://github.com/rails/rails/commit/e8cc4b116c460c524961a07da92da3f323854c15, but it's such a great feature that the least I can do is provide some link love for Edge Rails' new "application template":http://m.onkey.org/2008/12/4/rails-templates feature.

In a nutshell, this lets you create a Rails app already bootstrapped with your choice of plugins, gems and other base info specified.  No longer do you need to manually download your preferred libraries at the start of every project - you can save your configuration off to any text/ruby file and kick off a new app with:

<notextile>
{% highlight bash %}
rails blog -m ~/my_template.rb
{% endhighlight %}
</notextile>

Or apply an app template to an existing app:

<notextile>
{% highlight bash %}
rake rails:template LOCATION=http://mydomain.com/templates/start.rb
{% endhighlight %}
</notextile>

Go read up on the details of this great new feature in "Pratik's writeup covers":http://m.onkey.org/2008/12/4/rails-templates (which is wholly based on the "rg":http://github.com/jeremymcanally/rg/tree/master project by "Jeremy McAnally":http://omgbloglol.com/rejoice-rg-is-now-part-of-rail).
