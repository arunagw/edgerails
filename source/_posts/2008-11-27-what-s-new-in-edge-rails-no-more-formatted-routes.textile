span(version). *Rails* 2.3 or 3.0

Parallel to the "addition of :except and :only":/articles/2008/11/13/what-s-new-in-edge-rails-except-and-only-routing-options options to Rails' routing comes the "removal of all those @formatted_xxx@ named routes":http://github.com/rails/rails/commit/fef6c32afe2276dffa0347e25808a86e7a101af1.  Turns out these routes "ate up a lot of memory":http://blog.hungrymachine.com/2008/11/11/how-to-save-100m-of-ram-per-mongrel-part-2 and served minimal purpose.

So with this @routes.rb@ definition:

<notextile>
{% highlight ruby %}
ActionController::Routing::Routes.draw do |map|
  map.resources :articles
end
{% endhighlight %}
</notextile>

you'll no longer have any of the @formatted_xxx@ url helpers available.  However, you will be able to get the same functionality by passing in a @:format@ option to the base view helper methods:

<notextile>
{% highlight ruby %}
# Old => New
formatted_article_path(article, :xml) => article_path(article, :format => :xml)
formatted_new_article_path(:json) => new_article_path(:format => :json)
# etc...
{% endhighlight %}
</notextile>

A minimal change that will have a big impact on the memory consumption of each of your Rails processes - especially if you've got a complex app with lots of routes.

If you're on Edge Rails you're going to start seeing deprecation warnings where you reference these formatted url helpers, so you've got some warning before you have to make the switch.
