@Enumerable@ has received a few "handy ":http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/4491 little "extensions":http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/4489 in edge Rails.  The first is the ability to sum the contents of the enumerable:

@orders.sum { |o| o.total * discount }@

or

@orders.sum(&:total)@

For those interested in the implemention, it's pretty straight forward:
<pre>
<code>
def sum
  inject(0) { |sum, element| sum + yield(element) }
end
</code>
</pre>

And next we have @index_by@ which will convert an enumerable to a hash keyed on the given block.  This is definitely best explained with an example.  Suppose we have an array of City objects that we want to convert to a hash based on the city names:
<pre>
<code>
hash = cities.index_by(&:name)
hash #=> ["New York" => <City ...>, "London" => <City ...>]
</code>
</pre>

We now have a hash of cities keyed on the citys' names.

For those that aren't familiar with the @&:symbol@ syntax used as a parameter to these methods - it's just a way to form a block that says _get the value of the this symbol on the passed in object_.

So in the case of:

@orders.sum(&:total)@

what we're really saying is:

@orders.sum { |o| o.total }@

It's just a nice shortcut to access the value of a single property.
