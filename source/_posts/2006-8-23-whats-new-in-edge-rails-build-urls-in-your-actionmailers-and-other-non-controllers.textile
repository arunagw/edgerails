For a long time there was no _good_ way to generate a URL within an ActionMailer.  If you wanted to send a registration email when a user signs up for your application you would have had to _pass in_ the url to be included in the email:

<pre>
<code>
class MyController < ApplicationController
  def register
    # .. registration logic ...
    UserMailer.deliver_registration(user, home_url)
  end
end

class UserMailer < ActionMailer::Base
  def registration(user, url)
    @body = { 'user' => user, 'home' => url }
  end
end
</code>
</pre>

This is hardly a hack, but it's not as nice as it could be.  It would be nice if the mailer itself could generate the url - or perhaps if the email template itself could generate the url?  That day has come with the new "ActionController::UrlWriter":http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/4814 module.

Just include @ActionController::UrlWriter@ in your mailer and you get access to all the familiar @url_for@ and even the named url methods (@home_url@ in this example):

<pre>
<code>
class UserMailer < ActionMailer::Base
  include ActionController::UrlWriter
  def registration(user)
    @body = { 'user' => user, 'home' => home_url }
  end
end
</code>
</pre>
