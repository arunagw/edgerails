span(version). *Rails* 3.0

Wow, from the bombshell department comes the news that "Rails and Merb will be merging":http://rubyonrails.org/merb to form Rails 3.  It seems the Rails and Merb teams have acknowledged that there is good in both frameworks and that they can be combined into a singular web framework.

To be honest I don't love the idea of having less choice in Ruby web-framework world.  However, I do think this bodes well for Rails.  We can only hope innovation stays alive within the combined team (and that their perspectives only enhance each other and don't outright conflict).

_Read what "Yehuda":http://yehudakatz.com/2008/12/23/rails-and-merb-merge/, now a Rails core team member, "Ezra":http://brainspl.at/articles/2008/12/23/merb-is-rails, "Carl":http://splendificent.com/2008/12/the-merb-rails-merger-announcement-an-inside-opinion/ and "Matt":http://merbist.com/2008/12/23/rails-and-merb-merge/ have to say as well._

Little 'ole Rails is definitely growing up - lots of big stuff coming in Rails 3...
