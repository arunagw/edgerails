No, not the heavyweight annotations that you see in Java or C# - "these are just a way to denote the todos and other mental reminders":http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/6229 we often litter in our code comments:

<notextile>
{% highlight ruby %}
class ContactsController < ApplicationController
  
  # TODO: factor out model verification to a filter
  # OPTIMIZE: optimize this
  # FIXME: it's broken
  def index
    ...
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}
</notextile>

With this new rake task we can now spit out a list of items we've annotated:

<notextile>
{% highlight bash %}
rake notes
app/controllers/contacts_controller.rb:
  * [ 3] [TODO] factor out model verification to a filter
  * [ 4] [OPTIMIZE] optimize this
  * [ 5] [FIXME] it's broken
{% endhighlight %}
</notextile>

You can also only list the annotations of a particular kind with @rake notes:todo@, @rake notes:optimize@ and @rake notes:fixme@.

_Update: "JD":http://blog.wuputah.com/ has this tip to get this rake task installed in your non-edge Rails app.  Thanks, JD!_
<notextile>
{% highlight ruby %}
cd lib/tasks && \
  wget http://dev.rubyonrails.org/export/7553/trunk/railties/lib/tasks/annotations.rake
{% endhighlight %}
</notextile>

_Update: You can "now search for a custom annotation":http://github.com/rails/rails/commit/dc2d754d60378b529c239e1291932503d4d8fca5 by passing in the annotation text as follows:_
<notextile>
{% highlight ruby %}
rake notes:custom ANNOTATION=MYTAG
{% endhighlight %}
</notextile>
