It would appear that Rails' routing implementation is being gutted:

* "changeset 4394":http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/4394
* "changeset 4395":http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/4395
* "changeset 4396":http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/4396
* "changeset 4397":http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/4397

though we have been re-assured that the API remains unchanged.  Those messing with the routing internals, however, "expect breakage".
