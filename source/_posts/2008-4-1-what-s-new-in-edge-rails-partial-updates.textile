In lock-step with the recent "dirty objects":/articles/2008/3/31/what-s-new-in-edge-rails-dirty-objects functionality comes the ability of "ActiveRecord models to perform partial updates":http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/9157 - which only saves the attributes that have been modified on updates.

For instance:

<notextile>
{% highlight ruby %}
article = Article.find(:first)
article.title  #=> "Title"
article.subject  #=> "Edge Rails"

# Update one of the attributes
article.title = "New Title"

# And only that updated attribute is persisted to the db
article.save
  #=>  "UPDATE articles SET title = 'New Title' WHERE id = 1"
{% endhighlight %}
</notextile>

_Note:_ Your @updated_at/on@ magic fields will only be set if there are unsaved attributes that need persisting.  If there are no changed attributes for the object being persisted then there won't be any SQL updates made.

To disable this functionality, set @partial_updates = false@ for each model you wish to not take advantage of partial updates.  To disable this system-wide add this line to your @environment.rb@ or, better yet, in a @config/initializer@:

<notextile>
{% highlight ruby %}
ActiveRecord::Base.partial_updates = false
{% endhighlight %}
</notextile>

_Note:_ There's currently a @config/initializers/new_rails_defaults.rb@ file that has this setting, so edit that file if you have it.
