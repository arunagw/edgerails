p(info). This feature is schedule for: Rails v2.3 stable

"Rails' flash":http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/Flash.html is a convenient way of passing objects (though mostly used for message strings) across http redirects.  In fact, every time you set a flash parameter the very next step is often to perform your redirect w/ @redirect_to@:

<notextile>
<div class="code_window">
<em>Ruby &mdash; some_cool_file.rb</em>
{% highlight ruby %}
class UsersController < ApplicationController
  def create
    @user = User.create(params[:user])
    flash[:notice] = "The user was successfully created"
    redirect_to user_path(@user)
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}
</div>
</notextile>

I know I hate to see two lines of code where one makes sense - in this case what you're saying is to "redirect to the new user page with the given notice message" - something that seems to make more sense as a singular command.

DHH seems to agree and has "added @:notice@, @:alert@ and @:flash@ options to @redirect_to@":http://github.com/rails/rails/commit/e6cadd422b72ba9818cc2f3b22243a6aa754c9f8 to consolidate commands.  @:notice@ and @:alert@ automatically sets the flash parameters of the same name and @:flash@ let's you get as specific as you want.  For instance, to rewrite the above example:

<notextile>
{% highlight ruby %}
class UsersController < ApplicationController
  def create
    @user = User.create(params[:user])
    redirect_to user_path(@user), :notice =>"The user was successfully created"
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}
</notextile>

Or to set a non @:alert@/@:notice@ flash:

<notextile>
{% highlight ruby %}
class UsersController < ApplicationController
  def create
    @user = User.create(params[:user])
    redirect_to user_path(@user), :flash => { :info => "The user was successfully created" }
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}
</notextile>

I've become accustomed to setting my flash messages in @:error@, @:info@ and sometimes @:notice@ making the choice to provide only @:alert@ and @:notice@ accessors fell somewhat constrained to me, but maybe I'm loopy in my choice of flash param names.

Whatever your naming scheme, enjoy the new one-line redirect!
