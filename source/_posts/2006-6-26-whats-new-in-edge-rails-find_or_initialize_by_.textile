Parallel to the @find_or_create_by_X@ method that will find the requested model if it exists or create it and return it if it doesn't is the new "find_or_initialize_by_X":http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/4473 which will find the requested model or create, but not save it, if it doesn't exist.

The associated unit tests show us that an object initialized by this method is not yet saved to the database whereas the _create_ version is:

@assert Company.find_or_initialize_by_name("38signals").new_record? @

@assert !Company.find_or_create_by_name("38signals").new_record?@
