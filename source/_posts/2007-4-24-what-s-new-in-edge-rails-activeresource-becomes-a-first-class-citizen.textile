Despite the "previous allusions":/articles/2006/11/20/whats-new-in-edge-rails-activeresource-pulled-from-v1-2-world-weeps#comment-180 to the fact that ActiveResource might never be an official part of Rails, it "now looks":http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/6550 like it will.  The edge Rails source tree has been updated to auto-load the ActiveResource framework in @environment.rb@ (and does so at the expense of Action Web Service, no less).

There have been some minor updates to ActiveResource in the last few days by DHH himself, so it appears that the framework has been getting some TLC.  This is a good thing as ARes is a great little framework that just needs a little nudge into the lime-light.  "37 Signals' Highrise":http://www.highrisehq.com/ might just be "that nudge":http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000607.html.
