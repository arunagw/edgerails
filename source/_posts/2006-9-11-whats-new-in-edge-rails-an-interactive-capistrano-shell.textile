"This utility":http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/5085 comes with several warnings about its experimental state and unknown future - but we're not going to let that damper our inquisitiveness, are we?  Introducing a way to execute capistrano commands from a shell environment (think @script/console@).  So how does this Capistrano shell work?

First, start the capistrano shell w/

@cap -v shell@

Then enter commands to be executed on your remote environments.  (These are mostly from the "shell source comments":http://dev.rubyonrails.org/browser/tools/capistrano/lib/capistrano/shell.rb itself)

<pre>
<code>
# Execute on all servers
cap> echo ping

# Execute on specific servers
on myserver1.com,myserver2.com echo ping

# To execute based on roles
with app,db echo ping

# Execute a capistrano task
!deploy

# Execute multiple capistrano tasks
!setup deploy

# Combine all the goodness to execute a task on
# specific servers and roles
on myserver1.com !setup
with app !setup
</code>
</pre>

Why would you want to use this shell?  Well, you get the ability to simultaneously manipulate several environments from one shell - and all within the friendly confines of capistrano.  You should find the @rollback@ task to be especially comforting...
