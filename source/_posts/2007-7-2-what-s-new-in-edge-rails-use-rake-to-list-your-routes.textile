title: "Use Rake to List Your Routes"

While you've always been able to manually take a "peek at what routes":http://snipplr.com/view/2415/list-of-all-of-the-routes-you-have-defined/ are defined in your application, this dollop of usefulness has "now found its way into a rake task":http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/7149.

Just run

<notextile>
{% highlight ruby %}
rake routes
{% endhighlight %}
</notextile>

and voila, all routes defined will be spit out in a tidy columnar form with the following columns:

@route name, HTTP method, route path, route requirements@

As an example, here is what my output looks like:

<notextile>
{% highlight bash %}
   all_articles GET  /articles;all/      {:action=>"all", :controller=>"articles"}
search_articles GET  /articles;search/   {:action=>"search", :controller=>"articles"}
{% endhighlight %}
</notextile>

For those of us not riding edge, it's pretty easy to get access to this task in your app:
<notextile>
{% highlight bash %}
curl http://svn.rubyonrails.org/rails/trunk/railties/lib/tasks/routes.rake > lib/tasks/routes.rake
{% endhighlight %}
</notextile>

This is particularly useful in RESTful implementations as there's lot of routing magic happening for you under the covers.  Now you have the means to take a harmless peek under said covers.
