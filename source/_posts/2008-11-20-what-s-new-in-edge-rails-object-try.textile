p(info). This feature is scheduled for: Rails v2.3/3.0

Those of you using "Chris Wanstrath's slick little @try@ trick":http://ozmm.org/posts/try.html will now have access to that functionality in Rails with this "ActiveSupport update":http://github.com/rails/rails/commit/51730792ca930a896361eb92354a42bc56903de1.

Basically, @try@ lets you attempt to invoke a method on an object without worrying about a NoMethodError being raised.  If the method doesn't exist, or if the target object @nil@, then @nil@ will be returned without exceptions:

<notextile>
{% highlight ruby %}
# No exceptions when receiver is nil
nil.try(:destroy) #=> nil

# Useful when chaining potential nil items
User.admins.first.try(:address).try(:reset)
{% endhighlight %}
</notextile>

Just a small little bit of syntactical candy pulled in from the community.

_Update:_ You can now also use this trick for "methods with arguments":http://github.com/rails/rails/commit/823b623fe2de8846c37aa13250010809ac940b57
