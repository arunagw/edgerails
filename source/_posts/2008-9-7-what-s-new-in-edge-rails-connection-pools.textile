With the "upcoming thread-safety of Rails":http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2008/8/16/josh-peek-officially-joins-the-rails-core comes the necessity of "database connection pools":http://github.com/rails/rails/commit/6f932b4790371e548c0df9033da96b2cf8f51dcc.  While less a feature and more a hidden implementation detail, you do have the ability to adjust the max size of these new pools (default is 5).  In your database.yml configuration file just set the @pool@ key:

<notextile>
{% highlight ruby %}
development:
  adapter: mysql
  username: root
  database: myapp_dev
  pool: 10
{% endhighlight %}
</notextile>

So there ya go - connection pools.  That was easy...
