For those of you tired of referencing the fixture method when building a collection of fixtures, "your day has come":http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/6940

Gone are the days of unnecessary typing:

<notextile>
{% highlight ruby %}
fixtures :states
..
assert_equal [states(:nc), states(:va)], State.find(:all)
{% endhighlight %}
</notextile>

and here are the days of a convenient syntax for retrieving more than one fixture at a time:

<notextile>
{% highlight ruby %}
fixtures :states
..
assert_equal states(:nc, :va), State.find(:all)
{% endhighlight %}
</notextile>

Revolutionary?  No.  Useful? Yes.
