You know those "sexy migrations":http://errtheblog.com/post/2381 you've been lusting over?  Yeah, well they're "mainstream now":http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/6667.  I won't unnecessarily duplicate here what's already been written about them - but the gist is that a sexy migrations inspired syntax is now part of Rails.

You can now do:

<notextile>
{% highlight ruby %}
create_table "users", :force => true do |t| 
  t.integer :group_id, :employer_id
  t.string :first, :last
  t.timestamps
end
{% endhighlight %}
</notextile>

To get @integer@ columns in @group_id@ and @employer_id@ and @string@ columns in @first@ and @last@.  @timestamps@ gets you the "magic columns":http://rails.raaum.org/database-conventions.html#magic-columns @created_at@ and @updated_at@.

The list of supported column types are:

* @string@
* @text@
* @integer@
* @float@
* @decimal@
* @datetime@
* @timestamp@
* @time@
* @date@
* @binary@
* @boolean@

So spin that Barry White record and lay it down right, sexy's back.
