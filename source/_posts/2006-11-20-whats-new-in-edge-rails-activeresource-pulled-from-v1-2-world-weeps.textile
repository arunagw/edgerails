The REST client framework, "ActiveResource":/articles/2006/06/30/whats-new-in-edge-rails-activeresource-is-here, has "been pulled":http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/5554 from the up and coming Rails v1.2 release.

I've been using it to develop some REST client libraries and there are some refinements I can see being needed, but I don't know if that's the reasoning for its exclusion in the up-coming release.  As a quick refresher - ActiveResource is the client framework that lets you invoke REST services from model objects.  Think of it as ActiveRecord for REST.

However, get your REST panties out of their collective knot - you can still develop completely RESTful apps using the "Simply RESTful":/articles/2006/08/01/whats-new-in-edge-rails-simply-restful-support-and-how-to-use-it server side functionality and the "link helpers":/articles/2006/05/30/whats-new-in-edge-rails-restful-method-support-in-link-helpers for enhancing the web tier with REST compliant requests.
