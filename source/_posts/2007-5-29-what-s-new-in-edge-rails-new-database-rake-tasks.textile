Not two days after I just implemented these tasks myself for a client project "comes the addition of some useful rake tasks":http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/6849 that handle the provisioning of your database.

Want to create your database without having to drop into that pesky mysql command prompt?  Then I believe @rake db:create@ is your man.  Don't need that database anymore?  Give @rake db:drop@ a try.  Want to tear down your database and re-create it, migrations and all?  @rake db:reset@ is your jack-of-all-trades then.

And all the options you're used to when raking the database still apply:

<notextile>
{% highlight bash %}
# Drop the test database
RAILS_ENV=test rake db:drop

# Recreate the staging database, but only migrate it to version 3
RAILS_ENV=staging rake db:reset VERSION=3
{% endhighlight %}
</notextile>

If you haven't made @rake@ a part of your life yet, it's time you do so.
