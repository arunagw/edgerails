"Brian Donovan":http://brian.maybeyoureinsane.net/ has a "great writeup":http://brian.maybeyoureinsane.net/blog/2007/01/25/rails-duration/ of his new "Duration":http://dev.rubyonrails.org/browser/trunk/activesupport/lib/active_support/duration.rb fix to the Rails' "Time convenience methods":http://api.rubyonrails.com/classes/ActiveSupport/CoreExtensions/Numeric/Time.html that, until now, have been slightly broken.

Here's the summary.  Before (bad):

<notextile>
{% highlight ruby %}
Time.now
#=> Thu Jan 25 21:01:31 -0800 2007
1.month.from_now
#=> Sat Feb 24 21:01:34 -0800 2007
{% endhighlight %}
</notextile>

Oops - apparently one month only equals 30 days, not really one month.  But now, in edge:

<notextile>
{% highlight ruby %}
Time.now
#=> Thu Jan 25 21:01:31 -0800 2007
1.month.from_now
#=> Sun Feb 25 21:01:34 -0800 2007
{% endhighlight %}
</notextile>

And check out this little @inspect@ goodie:

<notextile>
{% highlight ruby %}
>> 3.weeks
#=> 21 days
{% endhighlight %}
</notextile>

And just so you're not mislead by this post's title, this fix applies to all the time helpers, not just @month.from_now@.  "Read the full rundown":http://brian.maybeyoureinsane.net/blog/2007/01/25/rails-duration/ to become fully enlightened.
