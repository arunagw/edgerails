"It would appear":http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/9067 that @has_one@ has finally grown up the stature of @has_many@ and now has support for the @:through@ option.

<notextile>
{% highlight ruby %}
class Magazine < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :subscriptions
end

class Subscription < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :magazine
  belongs_to :user
end

class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :subscriptions
  has_one :magazine, :through => : subscriptions, :conditions => ['subscriptions.active = ?', true]
end
{% endhighlight %}
</notextile>

The intermediate associations are properly handled when doing assignments as well:

<notextile>
{% highlight ruby %}
@ryan.subscriptions #=> []
@ryan.magazine = Magazine.create(:name => 'Hustler')
@ryan.subscriptions #=> [<Subscription magazine_id: 1, user_id: 1 ...>]
{% endhighlight %}
</notextile>
