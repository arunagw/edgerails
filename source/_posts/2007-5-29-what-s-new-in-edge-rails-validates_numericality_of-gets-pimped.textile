@validates_numericality_of@ "just got a shot of mojo":http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/6850 this weekend in the form of some highly useful options.

Prior to this recent change, your numerical validation options were limited to @only_integer@ and @allow_nil@.  Any desires to do anything slightly more complex meant dropping down into your own validation routine.  Now, some of the more common validations one might want on a number parameter have been option-ized, including:
* @greater_than@
* @greater_than_or_equal_to@
* @equal_to@
* @less_than@
* @less_than_or_equal_to@
* @odd@
* @even@

Which allows us to do things such as:

<notextile>
{% highlight ruby %}
validates_numericality_of :salary, :greater_than_or_equal_to => 40000
validates_numericality_of :ten, :equal_to => 10
validates_numericality_of :bonus, :less_than => 5000
validates_numericality_of :prime, :odd => true
{% endhighlight %}
</notextile>

So put away that crusty custom @validate@ and plug into these fresh validation options.  Guaranteed to make your life easier.
