Earlier today the inaugural [Rails Online Conf](http://en.oreilly.com/railswinter10) occurred and, Webex being a bag of hurt aside, it was a great experience.  Basically, we got a high-level rundown of most of the big changes (internal and external) in Rails 3 from an all-star lineup of Railstuds.  The slides are up on the site but if you want to save a single click-through, here they are again:

* [Yehuda gives us the Rails 3 overview](http://assets.en.oreilly.com/1/event/46/Getting%20up-to-date%20with%20Rails%203%20Presentation.pdf)
* [Gregg Pollack bats second with a spirited highlight reel of Rails 3 goodies](http://assets.en.oreilly.com/1/event/46/Rails%202%20to%20the%203%20_Abridged_%20Presentation.pdf)
* [Jeremy McAnally gives us the lowdown on upgrading from Rails 2 to 3](http://assets.en.oreilly.com/1/event/46/Why%20Port_%20Presentation.pdf)
* [Ryan Tomayko talks about Rack and Rails use of Rack to become more modular and extensible](http://assets.en.oreilly.com/1/event/46/Rack%20in%20Rails%203%20Presentation.pdf)

Don't forget to check out Jeremy's upcoming [Rails 3 Upgrade Handbook](http://railsupgradehandbook.com/) if you're in the market for test driving all the sweetness Rails 3 has to offer.  Jeremy's a great writer and this 120-page manual is sure to impress.

The RailsConf program committee of [Chad](http://chadfowler.com/) and [Ben](http://benscofield.com/) deserves a big "thanks" for putting on the online conf.  My hope is that mini-events like this become more frequent in the future.

If you missed out on this event and aren't a fan of visuals, you can always [download the audio recording](http://en.oreilly.com/railswinter10/public/sv/q/216) when it comes out.
