There's "now a convenient way":http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/4425 to call Active Record finder methods when the query is based solely on @AND@ ed equality conditions.

Before:

@Article.find(:all, :conditions => [ "author_id = ? and status = ?", @author.id, 'published' ], :limit => 10)@

Now:


@Article.find(:all, :conditions => { :author_id => @author.id, :status => 'published' }, :limit => 10)@

Instead of having to finagle with the SQL string and the correct number of @?@ placeholders - we can now just pass in the hash of parameters which will be @AND@ ed together to form the SQL query.

Ahh, that's nice.
