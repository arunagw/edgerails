The days of natively supported object transactions "are gone":http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/6439.  Object transactions you say?  Yeah, that nifty little trick that performs rollbacks not only of the database state, but of the object state as well:

<notextile>
{% highlight ruby %}
Account.transaction(from, to) do
  from.withdraw(100)
  to.deposit(100)
end
{% endhighlight %}
</notextile>

If there was a failure within the transaction block above not only would the database have been rolled back, but the internal state of each object argument (@from@ and @to@ in this case) would have as well.

This was previously deprecated, so if you're still using it, shame on you.  All is not lost, however - you can use "bitsweat's object transaction plugin":http://code.bitsweat.net/svn/object_transactions/ to get this behavior.
