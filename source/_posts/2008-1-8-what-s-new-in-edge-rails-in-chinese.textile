The virus that is Rails is spreading.  Thanks to "Yudi":http://yudionrails.com, my posts on new features in edge rails have _all_ been "translated into Chinese":http://yudionrails.com/2007/12/17/rails-2-0-final-released-summary-of-features.  Surely a good sign for Rails and Ruby.

Thanks to Yudi for doing the unenviable task of wading through my diatribes, I hope your hard work is appropriately rewarded.
