The "@script/server@":http://dev.rubyonrails.org/browser/trunk/railties/lib/commands/server.rb startup script that boots either WEBrick or "Lighttpd":http://www.lighttpd.net/ has gotten "an update":http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/4486 that will now start "mongrel":http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/ if it detects it on your system.

If you have both lighty and mongrel installed then the script will startup -lighty- "mongrel":http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/4507, and of course WEBrick is the fall back if nothing else is available.

As usual, you can force startup of a specific server by passing it in on the command line:

@script/server mongrel@
or
@script/server lighttpd@

Looks like mongrel's quick rise to prominence continues with the official backing of Rails...
