span(version). *Rails* 2.3 or 3.0

Ever wonder why your @ArticlesController@ has to live in a file called @articles_controller.rb@ but that special @ApplicationController@ gets to hang out in @application.rb@?  Well "no more":http://github.com/rails/rails/commit/fcce1f17eaf9993b0210fe8e2a8117b61a1f0f69.. That snooty little controller will now live in @application_controller.rb@ and abide by the same naming restrictions that the rest of us do.

By the time Rails 2.3/3.0 rolls around this "rename will happen":http://github.com/rails/rails/commit/9e08a3bb1d47f79b6953056e72eee58e86d83ead for you as part of @rake rails:update@.  However, for those of you on Edge Rails, you'll need to make this change yourself.
