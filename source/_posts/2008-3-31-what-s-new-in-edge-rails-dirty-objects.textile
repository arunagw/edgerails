The ability to track whether or not your active record objects have been modified or not becomes a lot easier with the "new dirty object functionality of edge rails":http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/9127.  It's dead simple, and pretty slick, to use:

<notextile>
{% highlight ruby %}
article = Article.find(:first)
article.changed?  #=> false

# Track changes to individual attributes with
# attr_name_changed? accessor
article.title  #=> "Title"
article.title = "New Title"
article.title_changed? #=> true

# Access previous value with attr_name_was accessor
article.title_was  #=> "Title"

# See both previous and current value with attr_name_change accessor
article.title_change  #=> ["Title", "New Title"]
{% endhighlight %}
</notextile>

Beyond the clever attribute based accessor methods, you can also query to object directly for its list of all changed attributes.  (Continuing from the previous example):

<notextile>
{% highlight ruby %}
# Get a list of changed attributes
article.changed  #=> ['title']

# Get the hash of changed attributes and their previous and current values
article.changes  #=> { 'title' => ["Title", "New Title"] }
{% endhighlight %}
</notextile>

_Note:_ Once you save a dirty object it clears out its changed state tracking and is once again considered unchanged.

<notextile>
{% highlight ruby %}
article.changed?  #=> true
article.save  #=> true
article.changed?  #=> false
{% endhighlight %}
</notextile>

If you're going to be modifying an attribute outside of the @attr=@ writer, you can use @attr_name_will_change!@ to tell the object to be aware of the change:

<notextile>
{% highlight ruby %}
article = Article.find(:first)
article.title_will_change!
article.title.upcase!
article.title_change  #=> ['Title', 'TITLE']
{% endhighlight %}
</notextile>

And coming down the pipe is a feature that will make the most of this functionality - "partial SQL updates":/articles/2008/4/1/what-s-new-in-edge-rails-partial-updates that will only update attributes that have changed...
