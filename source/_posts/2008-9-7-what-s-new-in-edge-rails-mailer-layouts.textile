Rails mailer templates "now have the ability to utilize layouts":http://github.com/rails/rails/commit/e9a8e0053be3b293ab89fb584f1d660063f107aa just like their view-template siblings.  The only caveat is that for a mailer layout to be automatically recognized it must end with @_mailer@.  So this mailer:

<notextile>
{% highlight ruby %}
class UserMailer < ActionMailer::Base
  def registration(user)
    subject    "You've registered"
    from       "system@example.com"
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}
</notextile>

would need a layout at @layouts/user_mailer.html.erb@.  If you explicitly specify the layout it doesn't need the @_mailer@ suffix.  So, in this example, a layout at @layouts/email.html.erb@ would suffice:

<notextile>
{% highlight ruby %}
class UserMailer < ActionMailer::Base
  layout 'email'
  ...
end
{% endhighlight %}
</notextile>

Go forth and make your emails pretty.  You've got all the tools now...
