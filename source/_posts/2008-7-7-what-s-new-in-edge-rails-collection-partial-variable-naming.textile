From the little-but-useful department comes a "new addition to Rails":http://github.com/rails/rails/commit/2b43620e3c1352028f19550fcde4632d65cbd191 that lets you explicitly name the local variable exposed to a partial template when using a collection partial.  So, for instance, in this statement:

<notextile>
{% highlight ruby %}
render :partial => 'employees', :collection => @workers, :as => :person
{% endhighlight %}
</notextile>

each element of the @workers@ collection will be exposed as @person@ within the @employees@ template.  No longer are you hostage to your template name.
