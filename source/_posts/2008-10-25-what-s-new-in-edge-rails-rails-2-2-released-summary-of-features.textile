p(notice). I've updated this post to reflect the features added after RC1, so consider this to be a full list of major 2.2 features

Rails 2.2 (RC1) was just released, let's take a peek at some of the major new features (as determined by yours truly - feel free to pipe up with features that I've missed).

Rails 2.2.2 requires rubygems v 1.3.1, so before you upgrade make sure to do a @sudo gem update --system@.
