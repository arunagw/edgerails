Configuring your action mailer settings just got a little tweak that you're going to want to pay attention to, especially if you're running off edge.  Instead of using @ActionMailer::Base.server_settings@ you're going to want to use @ActionMailer::Base.smtp_settings@.  The syntax remains the same, it's just a name change:

<notextile>
{% highlight ruby %}
ActionMailer::Base.delivery_method = :smtp
ActionMailer::Base.smtp_settings = {
	:address		=> "smtp.mymailserver.com",
	:authentication	=> :login,
	:user_name		=> "me",
	:password		=> "password"
}
{% endhighlight %}
</notextile>

In the "@1-2-stable@":http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/6094 rails branch the use of @server_settings@ has been deprecated, while over in "@edge@":http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/6095 it's been renamed outright and you'll need to update your usage.

Also in the same update is the ability to specify your sendmail executable location and command line arguments options with the new @ActionMailer::Base.sendmail_settings@ (if you're using sendmail):

<notextile>
{% highlight ruby %}
ActionMailer::Base.delivery_method = :sendmail
ActionMailer::Base.sendmail_settings = { 
  :location       => '/usr/sbin/sendmail', 
  :arguments      => '-i -t'
} 
{% endhighlight %}
</notextile>

See the "ActionMailer::Base":http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionMailer/Base.html api for further option details.
