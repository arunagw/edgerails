Edge Rails "just got":http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/7626 a "new, buffered logger":http://dev.rubyonrails.org/browser/trunk/activesupport/lib/active_support/buffered_logger.rb that will, apparently, make logging in Rails a little snappier.

This new logger is now the default, though you can change it back to the original logger in your @environment.rb@ with:

<notextile>
{% highlight ruby %}
config.logger = Logger.new('/path/to/log', Logger::DEBUG)
{% endhighlight %}
</notextile>

Though I'm not sure why you'd want to do that...
