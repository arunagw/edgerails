Those finder methods that have been marked for deprecation have now been "formally deprecated":http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/4682 using the nifty "deprecation feature":/articles/2006/07/28/whats-new-in-edge-rails-explicit-deprecation recently added to edge Rails.  So, if you currently use any one of:

* @find_on_conditions@
* @find_first@
* @find_all@

be prepared to get a little slap on the hand in the form of an error message: @Your application calls ActiveRecord::Base##find_XXX, which is now deprecated. Please see the API documents at http://api.rubyonrails.org/ for more information.@

Shame on you.

_On a related note - using "@push_with_attributes@":http://api.rubyonrails.com/classes/ActiveRecord/Associations/ClassMethods.html#M000533 is also "deprecated":http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/4680.  Use "@has_many :through@":http://api.rubyonrails.com/classes/ActiveRecord/Associations/ClassMethods.html#M000530 instead._
