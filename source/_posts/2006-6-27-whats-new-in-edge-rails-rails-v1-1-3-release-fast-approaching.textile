"Looks like Rails v1.1.3 is almost here":http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/4496 (after this "false alarm":http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/4488 saturday.)

I'll try to wrap up the changes between 1.1.2 and 1.1.3 in another post when it's official.

_"Looks like":http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2006/6/27/rails-1-1-3-security-fix-and-minor-fixes it's just some small security fixes - so not much to detail here..._
