Rails got a nice little bit of "organizational mojo":http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/6212 today.  I'm sure we all have litterings of various configs at the bottom or our @environment.rb@ files, like inflections, mail configs etc...  Here's the bottom of one of my projects' environment files:

<notextile>
{% highlight ruby %}
# Mail
ActionMailer::Base.delivery_method = :sendmail
...

# Exception notification
ExceptionNotifier.exception_recipients = %w(ryan@me.com)
...

# Various engine configs
...

# Custom date formats
ActiveSupport::CoreExtensions::Date::Conversions::DATE_FORMATS.merge!(:concise => "%d.%b.%y")
..
{% endhighlight %}
</notextile>

Pretty ugly after the structure and conciseness of the @Rails::Initializer@ block, huh?  Well now you can place your little bits of initialization code in a @config/initializers/@ directory and they will get pulled in and loaded after the @Rails::Initializer@ runs.

So now instead of polluting your environment file you can create a single file for each initialization task:

@config/initializers/mail.rb@:
<notextile>
{% highlight ruby %}
ActionMailer::Base.delivery_method = :sendmail
ActionMailer::Base.default_charset = "utf-8"
{% endhighlight %}
</notextile>

@config/initializers/date_formats.rb@:
<notextile>
{% highlight ruby %}
ActiveSupport::CoreExtensions::Date::Conversions::DATE_FORMATS.merge!(:concise => "%d.%b.%y")
ActiveSupport::CoreExtensions::Date::Conversions::DATE_FORMATS.merge!(:medium => "%b %e, %Y")
{% endhighlight %}
</notextile>

Now go clean your environment file, filthy lil' runts.

_It should be noted that these initialization files are loaded at startup for all environments, it is not a place to put environment-specific (dev, test, prod etc...) configs_
